// failure (no/expired session) `redirect()`s to the BFF login flow,
// which never paints on the client — the redirect throw is unwound
// before the layout renders. ADR-0017 / ADR-0018.
//
// For regular users we prefetch their organizations here so the nav's
// org switcher hydrates on first paint. Super-admins are a disjoint
// user type — they don't own/join orgs and the nav doesn't render the
// switcher for them, so we skip the prefetch entirely.

// `redirect()` throws a NEXT_REDIRECT marker that React unwinds before
// rendering. It must NOT be wrapped in try/catch — otherwise the marker
// is swallowed and the redirect silently fails.
