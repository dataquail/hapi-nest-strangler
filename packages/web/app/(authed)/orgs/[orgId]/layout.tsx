// Membership guard for the /orgs/[orgId]/* subtree. Calls `/orgs` via
// the BFF (the caller's `findMine` list) and 404s if the URL's orgId
// isn't in it. We use `notFound()` rather than `redirect("/")` so a
// share-link to an org you don't belong to surfaces as a Not Found
// page instead of bouncing the user without explanation. Super-admins
// who aren't a member fall out the same way — Phase 9 can add an
// "impersonate org" path if needed.
