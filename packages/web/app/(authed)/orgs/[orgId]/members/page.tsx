// Org members page. The parent layout has already verified the caller
// is a member of `orgId`. The roster is member-readable, so every
// member sees it — but read-only: the management controls (promote /
// demote / remove) and the pending-invitations section are admin-only,
// gated here on the caller's role from `findMine`. The OrgNav "Members"
// link is shown to everyone; Billing / Invite are not. The backing
// endpoints independently enforce their own gates.
