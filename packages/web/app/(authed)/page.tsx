// Root authed route. Two branches depending on the caller's user type:
// - Regular user → organization picker (their memberships) + create-org
//   form. Choosing an org navigates into `/orgs/[orgId]/`.
// - Super-admin → redirect to `/admin/orgs`. SAs are a disjoint user
//   type, they don't own organizations, and their natural landing
//   page is the platform-wide org admin view.
//
// The `myOrgs` query is prefetched by the parent (authed) layout for the
// nav switcher (regular users only); the picker reads the same entry and
// hydrates from that entry without a duplicate fetch.
