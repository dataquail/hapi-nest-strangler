# The commands this wraps drive `docker compose` from the workspace. In a
# codespace that workspace is itself a container, so Compose resolves the
# relative bind paths to container-side paths and hands them to the VM's
# daemon, which creates them as empty directories. The stack then comes back
# with mounts pointing at nothing — and because the services use fixed
# `container_name`s, the damaged containers replace the working ones and the
# codespace fails to start.
#
# `--skip` is for steps inside a composite task: a codespace has already done
# the work at container creation, so the step is genuinely unnecessary rather
# than wrong, and failing it would take the whole task down with it.

  Here the stack is already running — the dev container is one of its
  services. What you probably want:

    provision / re-run the seed   node scripts/codespaces-provision.mjs
    logs                          docker logs -f nest-hexagon-zitadel
    a clean slate                 rebuild or recreate the codespace

  See docs/codespaces.md.
